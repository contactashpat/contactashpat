# My App
   

## Basic react app with node express server at the backend

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Change the directory to cd server and run:
### `yarn start`
                   

To run tests run:
### `yarn test`

## Project
I have used chance library to get some meaningful data for the backend. The backend is a very basic express server. The frontend is using React. I have created some custom hooks for data fetching. I would be good to add smart error retry, caching and deduplication logic in the custom useApi hook. I need to give https://swr.vercel.app/docs/getting-started this a try.
